  First, the principal has to authenticate with the authenticator. A
  shared-secret mechanism is being used, and the negotitaion goes like this:

  A = Authenticator
  P = Principle
  S = Service

  1. Obtaining principal/auth session key

  (Authenticate Request)
  p->a : principal, principal_addr.  authenticate me!

 ...authenticator does lookup in database...

  a->p : A= {principal/auth session key, validity}^principal_secret (*)
         B= {principal ticket, validity, principal/auth session key}^authsecret


  [principal/auth session key, validity] = service ticket
  [principal ticket, validity, principal/auth session key] = service ticket info

  (*) annotation: ^ signifies 'encrypted by'
  At this point, if is genuine, the principal should have the principal/auth
  session key at hand. The next step would be to request an authorization to
  use some other service:

  2. Obtaining principal/service session key

  p->a : B, {principal_addr, timestamp}^principal/auth session key.  authorize
         me!
  a->p : E= {service ticket}^svcsecret
         F= {principal/service session key, validity}^principal/auth session key

  principal_addr, timestamp = authenticator

  service ticket = principal name, client network address, validity, principal/service session key

  Note that steps 1 and 2 are pretty much the same thing; contacting the
  authenticator and requesting for a key.

  Following this the principal should have a principal/service session key that
  could be used later on for creating a session:

  3. Opening a session to a service

  p->s : E + {principal_addr, timestamp}^principal/service session key
  s->p : {timestamp+1}^principal/service/session key

  timestamp+1 = reply authenticator

  Now, the principal is fully authenticated with the service. So, logically we
  have 2 main actions here. The first one would be to obtain a session key to
  the service (steps 1 and 2), and the second one would be to authenticate with
  the service, using that ticket.
